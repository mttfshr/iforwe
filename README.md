# I For We

A tool for crowdsourcing, conceptualizing and visualizing interconnected artmaking. The tool grabs social graph info from Facebook profiles to establish a family tree of Bay Area artists collectives, cooperatives, groups and aliases.

Still in sketch phase, and is part of a planned 2-part exhibition at Pro Arts Gallery in Oakland, CA in Spring 2017.

## Getting Started

There's nothing to install or run yet. Right now the tool is planned as a web application.
