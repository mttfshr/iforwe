# I For We

A tool for aiding exhibition research and design. The tool helps in crowdsourcing information to organize and visualize interconnections between Bay Area artists collectives, cooperatives, groups and aliases.

Still in sketch phase, and is part of a planned 2-part exhibition at Pro Arts Gallery in Oakland, CA in 2018.

# What is going on here?

More information about the exhibition and how this tool is meant to work with it is in the project wiki.

This readme will focus on installing, using, and contributing to the tool.

This repo is being shared with advisors and cohort members while in very early development and for right now you shouldn't try to download or install any of this code. It's pre-alpha.

Once the stack is finalized I'll write instructions on installing and configuring the repo. But peek in the code and you'll be able to tell that since it's a Node.js based project the steps are going to be to d/l, npm install, npm run dev.
