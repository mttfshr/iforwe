# I For We

A tool for aiding exhibition research and design. The tool helps in crowdsourcing information to organize and visualize interconnections between Bay Area artists collectives, cooperatives, groups and aliases.

Still in sketch phase, and is part of a planned 2-part exhibition at Pro Arts Gallery in Oakland, CA in 2018.

# What is going on here?

More information about the exhibition and how this tool is meant to work with it is in the project wiki.

This readme will focus on installing, using, and contributing to the tool.
